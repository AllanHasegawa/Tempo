# Tempo

A Kotlin library for Android to get the current time from multiple sources: SNTP, GPS; or your own time source.

*Why is it important?*

> System.currentTimeMillis() [...] can be set by the user [...] so the time may jump backwards or forwards unpredictably.

You can check how Tempo works in this [blog post](https://medium.com/@AllanHasegawa/tempo-a-new-android-library-to-get-the-time-from-multiple-sources-276f7fcff7b7).

## Basic usage

Initialize the library in your `Application` class:

    class MyApp : Application {
        override fun onCreate() {
            Tempo.initialize(this)
            ...
        }
    }
    
After the library is initialized, you can get the time with:

    val timeNowInMs = Tempo.now()
    
`Tempo::now()` will return either a `Long` or a `null`. A `null` is returned when *Tempo* has not been
initialized yet. When initialized, `Tempo::now()` returns the current
[unix epoch time](https://www.epochconverter.com/) in milliseconds.

You can observe all the events emitted by the library:

    Tempo.observeEvents().subscribe {
        if (it is Tempo.Initialized) {
            Log.i("Tempo", "Initialized!")
        }
    }
    
## Dependency

Add the snippet below in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

    allprojects {
        repositories {
            ...
            maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	    }
	}

Then, add the dependency to your module:
	
    dependencies {
        compile 'com.github.AllanHasegawa.Tempo:tempo:x.y.z'
    }

## Time Sources

*Tempo* comes with two sources for time: `SlackSntpTimeSource` and `AndroidGPSTimeSource`.

### SlackSntpTimeSource

The `SlackSntpTimeSource` is the default time source. Tempo is using a SNTP client implementation from the Android Framework. However, it's named "slack" because we are not enforcing a minimum roundtrip delay. The main reason behind this decision is because users with poor connection (very common on mobile) may never get a low enough roundtrip delay to successfully complete a SNTP request; retrying will just waste battery and increate data consumption. Therefore, this is the recommended time source to be used for Android.

This time source requires an active internet connection to work.


### AndroidGPSTimeSource

The `AndroidGPSTimeSource` uses the device's GPS to get the current time. The accuracy will
vary depending on the GPS.

This time source is in a separated module because it adds the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission.
Only use this module if you need this functionality.

To include it in your project, include the dependency:

    compile 'com.github.AllanHasegawa.Tempo:tempo-android-gps-time-source:x.y.z'
    
Then, add it during initialization:

    Tempo.initialize(this,
      timeSources = listOf(SlackSntpTimeSource(), AndroidGPSTimeSource(this))
      
*Warning*: If you are targeting Android SDK 23 or higher, you will have to request for the GPS
[permission at runtime](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting.html).

### Custom time source

You can create your own time source. Implement the `io.tempo.TimeSource`
interface and then add it during initialization:

    val customTs = MyCustomTs()
    Tempo.initialize(this,
      timeSources = listOf(customTs))
      
      
## Schedulers

A device's clock slowly drifts away from an accurate time. Therefore, *Tempo* also offers an
scheduler to automatically sync its time.

To add, first include its module to your gradle build file:

    compile 'com.github.fangzhzh.Tempo:tempo-android-workmanager-scheduler:x.y.z'
    
Then, add it during initialization:

    Tempo.initialize(this,
      scheduler = WorkManagerScheduler(periodicIntervalMinutes = 60L))

Note: The old `tempo-android-job-scheduler` is **deprecated** and no longer supported.

## FAQ

1. What happens if the application gets destroyed?

By default, *Tempo* survives an application's process death.
It accomplishes it by saving its state in the app's shared preference storage.

2. What happens if the user reboots the device?

We invalidate all cache and a complete sync is required.

3. What happens if the user has no internet access, no GPS, and rebooted his phone?

Then you should use a fallback strategy, like `System.currentTimeMillis()`.

4. Will *Tempo* ever support Java?

If there's enough interest. Open an issue if you would like to use it with Java.
